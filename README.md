# Music Recommender

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This AI will take music the user usually listen to as input, and generate a playlist of all new songs which the user might like. It can take input from Spotify, SoundCloud, Tidal, YouTube, Apple Music and others to get the most complete training set.


## Background

Finding new music can be difficult and tedious. Often recommendations from for example Spotify are not great. Recommendations for music are often given by friends and social media, but our listen horizon won't be very broad by this. Some times our music preferences depends on mood, weather and other factors, something this AI will take into consideration when making a playlist. 


## How is it used?

Anyone listening to music can take full advantage of this AI. Even if it is just for a recommendation for one single song, or for many long playlists.



## Data sources and AI methods

The data sources will be liked songs and created playlists on the most popular music streaming sites such as Spotify, SoundCloud and Apple Music using their APIs ([Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), [SoundCloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com) and [Apple Music](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/)). 

The AI would probably be looking at the beat, tempo and pitch, but wouldn't necessary be known since the AI figures out the features/tweeks by itself.


## Challenges

Identifying the current mood and weather might prove a challenge when implementing this project, which is why those features would not be taken a lot into consideration in the early stages.


## What next?

To move on, we would have to go even more into learning AI. After that we can look into some music platformers APIs to start downloading testing sets and experimenting with that before we create the first recommendations.
